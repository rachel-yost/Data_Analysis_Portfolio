# Exploratory Analysis on the Effects of Weather Conditions and Aging on Marathon Performance


### Abstract

Previous studies have found that environmental temperature decreases
marathon performance. Additionally, older adults experience
difficulties with thermoregulation. Using data provided by Dr. Brett
Romano and Dr. Matthew Ely from the Department of Health Sciences at
Providence College, we performed an exploratory data analysis aiming
to examine the effects of increasing age on marathon performance in
men and women; explore the impact of environmental conditions on
marathon performance, and whether the impact differs across age and
gender; and identify the weather parameters that have the largest
impact on marathon performance. We hypothesized that the weather would
have a stronger negative impact on older runners, and that effects
would be similar between men and women. Furthermore,we suspected that
relative humidity, temperature, and solar radiation would have the
strongest impact on runners. Based on the results of my exploratory
data analysis, weather has a stronger impact on runners as age
increases, but effects do not vary significantly by gender.
Furthermore, based on a linear regression and correlations between
race results and weather conditions, we found that relative humidity,
air quality, and solar radiation have the largest impact on marathon
performance. Future research is needed to statistically analyze the
impact of weather, age, and gender on marathon performance.
